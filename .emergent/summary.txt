<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial high-level requests were:
1.  Create an interactive form builder sandbox on the demo page.
2.  Fix website navigation: The top menu bar should be sticky and always visible. Buttons like Features were not working.
3.  Update Call-to-Actions (CTAs): Remove Request a Demo and replace it with Start Free Trial and an onboarding wizard.
4.  Update the pricing page (): Add the menu bar and remove comparisons to SurveyCTO.
5.  Address the Watch Demo button's functionality.
6.  Create a pricing calculator to show the cost of FieldForce and allow margin adjustments. This should be hidden from the public.
7.  Expand the Trusted Across Industries section with better, more diverse use cases and remove WASH.
8.  Ensure the application can handle high traffic by implementing a production-ready architecture.
9.  Create a comprehensive interactive product demo page that allows users to experience the product's features (Dashboard, Forms, Submissions, GPS, Media) with pre-populated sample data, without needing to log in.
10. Make the interactive demo (and the real application) more interactive by making dashboard cards and table list action icons clickable.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a SaaS platform called FieldForce for data collection. The public-facing site includes a landing page, a pricing page, and two demo pages.
1.  : An Interactive Form Builder Sandbox where users can drag and drop to build a sample form.
2.  : A full-featured interactive product demo showcasing the dashboard, forms, submissions, team management, GPS map, and media gallery with pre-populated sample data. Features requiring a backend (like saving or exporting) are disabled with tooltips.

The backend has been scaffolded for a high-traffic, production-ready environment using Docker Compose, Nginx (as a load balancer), Redis (for caching and rate-limiting), and Celery (for background tasks). However, these services are not configured with credentials in the preview environment.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user pointed out that the cards on the interactive demo dashboard and action icons in the table lists were not clickable. The agent began implementing this by adding  functionality to these components to open detail modals or drawers, making the demo feel more realistic. The agent was in the process of modifying  to handle row clicks.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The interactive demo page () and the main application lack full interactivity. (Priority: P0)

    -   **Issues Detail:**
        -   **Issue 1:** Dashboard cards, project lists, and table rows in the interactive demo are not clickable. The user requested that clicking these elements should show more details (e.g., in a modal or drawer) and that this fix should be applied from the application level as well, meaning the real components should also be interactive.
            -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent started updating  to include state for modals/drawers and began modifying  to accept an  prop.
            -   **Next debug checklist:**
                1.  Finalize the changes in  to handle row clicks and trigger a detail view modal.
                2.  Implement click handlers for the Dashboard project cards in .
                3.  Implement click handlers for the form cards in .
                4.  Review the actual application components (e.g., , , ) and ensure they have the same  interactivity, navigating to the correct detail pages.
            -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will significantly improve the user experience for both the interactive demo and the real application, making it more intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
            -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
            -   **Is recurring issue?** N
            -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
            -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Make the Interactive Demo and Real Application More Interactive (Priority: P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue editing . The last action was an attempt to make the component accept an  handler for table rows.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The interactive demo will become a more faithful and engaging representation of the final product. The real application's usability will be enhanced.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Configure Production Services (P1):** The production infrastructure (Redis, S3) is scaffolded but not enabled. The agent needs to guide the user on how to provide the necessary environment variables () to activate these services for a real deployment. This involves connecting  to actual S3 credentials and  to a running Redis instance.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Interactive Form Builder:** Created an interactive form builder sandbox on the  page.
-   **Site-wide Navigation & UI:** Implemented a sticky header across all public pages, fixed navigation links, and standardized CTAs to Start Free Trial and Try Interactive Demo.
-   **Pricing Page Update:** Added the navigation header and removed all competitor comparisons (e.g., SurveyCTO).
-   **Internal Pricing Calculator:** Built a detailed pricing calculator and hid it behind the non-public URL .
-   **Landing Page Content:** Overhauled the Use Cases section, expanding it from 4 to 8 industries with a better layout.
-   **Production Infrastructure Scaffolding:** Set up a production-ready backend architecture with , Nginx for load balancing, Redis for caching/rate-limiting, Celery for background tasks, and S3 integration points.
-   **Comprehensive Interactive Demo:** Created a multi-tab interactive product demo at  with realistic, pre-populated sample data and disabled actions to encourage sign-ups.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent successfully self-corrected an initial path confusion ( vs. ) and addressed all user requests sequentially.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Issue recurrence in previous fork: None
-   Recurrence count: 0
-   Status: NA

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Architecture:** Microservices-ready setup using Docker.
-   **Scalability:** Nginx (Load Balancer), Redis (Caching, Rate Limiting, Message Queue), Celery (Background Tasks), AWS S3 (for file storage, integrated via ).

**key DB schema**
While not explicitly defined, the collections can be inferred from the application's structure:
-   : {user_id, name, email, role, organization_id}
-   : {project_id, name, description, owner_id}
-   : {form_id, project_id, title, fields: [...]}
-   : {submission_id, form_id, data: {...}, location, enumerator_id, media_files: [...]}

**changes in tech stack**
-   No fundamental changes, but significant additions to support a scalable production environment: **Nginx, Redis, and Celery** were introduced into the architecture.

**All files of reference**
*New Files Created:*
-   : Dockerfile for the production backend image.
-   : Celery application instance.
-   : Middleware for rate limiting and request ID.
-   : Example background tasks.
-   : Documentation for the new production architecture.
-   : Docker Compose file to orchestrate production services.
-   : Nginx configuration for load balancing.
-   : The shell for the full product demo.
-   : All the tab components for the product demo.
-   : The hidden pricing calculator page.

*Key Files Modified:*
-   : Added production middleware, health check endpoints, and Redis initialization.
-   : Added , , .
-   : Added routes for the interactive demo and the cost analyzer.
-   : Updated use cases, CTAs, and navigation IDs.
-   : Added header, removed competitor text, linked to calculator (and then removed the link).
-   : Made header sticky and updated navigation logic.
-   : Added a prominent link to the new full interactive demo.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The interactive demo components in  are separate from the real application components. While this isolates the demo, it could lead to code duplication. A future refactor could involve making the real components demo-aware via props to reduce maintenance overhead.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Basic health check.
-   : Comprehensive health check showing status of DB, Redis, and S3.
-   All existing API endpoints are now behind the production middleware for rate limiting and request tracking.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The production infrastructure (Nginx, multiple backend instances, Redis, Celery) is defined in  but is **not used** in the preview environment. The preview runs a simpler setup.
-   The backend health check () will correctly report Redis and S3 as unavailable because they are not configured in the preview environment. This is expected behavior.
-   The user's last request was to make UI elements clickable not just in the demo (), but from the application level as well. Ensure the interactivity fixes are applied to the core reusable components, not just the demo pages.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** None.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   The entire interactive demo at  uses hardcoded JSON data to simulate a real application state.
    -   In the preview environment, the production services (Redis, S3) are effectively mocked/disabled in the backend. The code calls them, but they will fail gracefully as they are not configured.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **AWS S3** (via ): Integrated into the backend code for file storage but requires User API Key (AWS credentials) to be configured in the production environment.
-   **Redis:** Integrated for caching, rate-limiting, and as a Celery broker. Requires a running Redis instance and connection URL in the production environment.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: None

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. All recent work is on public-facing pages or the non-authenticated interactive demo.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent was in the middle of fulfilling the user's last request. The agent needs to complete the implementation of making UI elements clickable, ensuring the changes apply to both the interactive demo and the core application components as requested by the user.</analysis>
