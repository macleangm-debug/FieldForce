<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial request was to make UI elements in the interactive product demo clickable. Throughout the session, the user expanded the scope with several additional feature requests to enhance the demo experience:
1.  Implement animated transitions between tabs.
2.  Redesign the  page to replace a Video Walkthrough with a more polished Interactive Demo entry point.
3.  Improve the presentation of the main interactive demo () by wrapping it in a device or browser frame.
4.  Generalize the demo data by removing Kenya-specific content and using generic placeholders.
5.  Implement customizable demo data, allowing users to select an industry (e.g., Healthcare, Agriculture) to see relevant data.
6.  Add a guided tour with tooltips to walk users through the demo's features.
7.  Investigate the existence of a light/dark mode feature.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React-based web application for a product named FieldForce. It's a single-page application with client-side routing. All data is currently mocked on the frontend.

The following features have been successfully implemented and verified during this session:
-   **Interactive Demo:** All key UI elements in the demo (project cards, submission rows, form cards, team member cards) are clickable and open detailed modal views.
-   **Polished Animations:** The demo features smooth, directional transitions between tabs and an animated active tab indicator, powered by Framer Motion.
-   **Redesigned Demo Pages:** Both the entry demo page () and the interactive sandbox () have been redesigned. The sandbox is now presented within a sleek browser window frame to make it look like a real application.
-   **Customizable & Generic Demo:** The demo data is no longer hardcoded or region-specific. It's now fully generic and can be dynamically switched between different industries (Healthcare, Agriculture, Education) via a dropdown selector in the header.
-   **Guided Tour:** A Start Tour button in the demo header launches a step-by-step guided tour that highlights key features with tooltips, similar to popular SaaS onboarding experiences.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was investigating the existence and implementation details of a light/dark mode feature, as requested by the user.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool to capture both light and dark modes of key pages after locating the theme switcher.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding issues or bugs at this time.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Analyze and Verify Light/Dark Mode (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has confirmed a theme system exists using Zustand () and a  component. The next step is to finish analyzing  to see how the theme is applied and where the  is rendered in the UI. After locating it, the agent needs to test the functionality.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will confirm whether a fully functional light/dark mode exists. If it's incomplete, the task will be to fix it and make it accessible.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming or future tasks requested by the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **State Management:** Zustand
-   **Animation:** Framer Motion
-   **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui
-   **Routing:** React Router

**key DB schema**
N/A. The project uses mock data on the frontend.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main file for the interactive demo. It was heavily modified to add clickability, animations, the browser frame, custom data, and the guided tour.
-   : Redesigned to be a polished landing page for the demo experiences.
-   : A new file created to hold the various industry-specific datasets for the customizable demo.
-   : A new file created to house the guided tour logic and UI.
-   : An existing file that was viewed to understand the theme implementation.
-   : The root application component, viewed to understand how the theme is applied globally.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The file  has become very large and complex. It contains many sub-components (tabs, modals) defined inline. For better maintainability, these sub-components should be extracted into their own files within the  directory.

**key api endpoints**
N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly engaged and provides iterative feedback and new feature requests. Be prepared for a dynamic workflow.
-   The current focus is on enhancing the product's demo experience.
-   The immediate task is to investigate the existing light/dark mode functionality. You have already confirmed a theme store and component exist. Your next step is to locate the theme switcher in the UI and verify its operation.
-   The file  is central to most recent features but is large. Be cautious when making edits.
